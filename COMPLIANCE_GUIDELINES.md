## 1. Federal Regulations

### 1.1 FTC -- Section 5 of the FTC Act (Deceptive/Unfair Practices)

All advertising claims must be:
- **Truthful** and not misleading
- **Substantiated** before dissemination (the advertiser must have evidence *before* making the claim)
- **Fair** -- not likely to cause substantial consumer injury

The term "advertising" covers websites, social media, brochures, videos, press releases, email marketing, and all digital content.

### 1.2 FTC Health Claims Substantiation Standard

Health-related claims require **"competent and reliable scientific evidence"** defined as:
- Tests, analyses, research, or studies conducted and evaluated objectively by qualified experts
- Generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results
- Sufficient in quality and quantity based on standards in the relevant scientific fields

**Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** are the gold standard. Replication by independent researchers provides the strongest substantiation.

### 1.3 FTC Endorsement Guides (Revised 2023, effective 2024)

Key rules for patient testimonials:
- A testimonial depicting atypical results **cannot be cured** by disclaimers like "results not typical" or "individual results may vary"
- If testimonial results are not typical, the ad **must clearly disclose what results consumers can generally expect**
- FTC research found that "results not typical" disclaimers do **not** adequately reduce the impression that depicted experiences are representative
- **Material connections must be disclosed** -- if a patient received free or discounted treatment in exchange for a testimonial, this must be stated

**Source**: [FTC Endorsements, Influencers, and Reviews](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/advertising-marketing/endorsements-influencers-reviews)

### 1.4 FTC Consumer Review Rule (Effective October 2024)

Prohibits:
- **Fake or AI-generated reviews** -- reviews by people who do not exist or did not have actual experience
- **Incentivized reviews** -- compensation conditioned on expressing a particular sentiment (positive or negative)
- **Undisclosed insider reviews** -- reviews by company insiders without clear disclosure of the material connection
- **Review suppression** -- using legal threats, intimidation, or false accusations to prevent or remove negative reviews
- **Fake social media indicators** -- buying followers, views, or engagement generated by bots

Violations can result in **civil penalties of up to $53,088 per violation**.

### 1.5 HIPAA -- Patient Testimonials and Reviews

- **Written HIPAA authorization is required** before using any patient testimonial, photo, video, or identifying information for marketing
- Authorization must specify: who may use the information, where it will be used (website, social media, print), how it will be used, expiration date, and how the patient can revoke consent
- **Responding to online reviews**: Providers must NOT confirm someone is a patient. Even responses like "thanks for coming in" or "it was great to see you" are considered HIPAA violations as they confirm patient status
- Patients may share their own information voluntarily; it is the **provider** who must not disclose PHI without authorization
- Penalties: Fines of $25,000+ plus years of corrective action plans

### 1.6 FDA -- Medical Devices and Treatment Claims

- **Contact lenses** (including scleral lenses, ortho-K, MiSight) are Class II or III medical devices regulated by the FDA
- Marketing claims about medical devices must be consistent with their **FDA-cleared indications**
- **MiSight 1 day** is the first and currently only FDA-approved contact lens for myopia control in children ages 8-12, shown to reduce myopia progression by up to 59%
- **Stellest spectacle lenses** (Essilor) received FDA approval for marketing as myopia control devices for children ages 6-12
- **OptiLight IPL** (Lumenis) is the first and only FDA-approved IPL device for managing dry eye disease due to meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)
- **Ortho-K** has FDA approval for myopia correction (not specifically for myopia control/slowing progression) -- marketing it as "controlling" or "slowing" myopia is technically off-label
- Off-label use claims require extra caution: practitioners may discuss off-label uses with patients but should not broadly advertise off-label indications as if FDA-approved

## 4. DO's and DON'Ts by Category

### 4.1 Treatment and Condition Claims

#### DO
- Use language like "manage," "treat," "help relieve symptoms of," "shown to slow progression of"
- Include qualifying language: "may help," "designed to," "studies suggest"
- Reference FDA-approved indications accurately (e.g., "MiSight is FDA-approved to slow myopia progression in children ages 8-12")
- State that "individual results may vary" AND disclose what typical results consumers can generally expect (per FTC Endorsement Guides)
- Cite published clinical evidence when making specific efficacy claims

#### DON'T
- Use the word **"cure"** for conditions like dry eye, myopia, or any chronic eye condition -- this implies permanent resolution and is almost certainly unsubstantiated
- Claim treatments **"eliminate"** or **"permanently fix"** chronic conditions
- **Guarantee treatment outcomes** or use language implying guaranteed results (e.g., "guaranteed to improve your vision," "100% success rate")
- Make claims that create **"unjustified expectations of favorable results"** (Georgia Rule 430-6-.01)
- Advertise **off-label uses** of medical devices as if they are FDA-approved indications

### 4.2 Superlative and Comparative Claims

#### DO
- Use verifiable, substantiated comparative claims backed by evidence (e.g., survey data, awards from recognized bodies)
- If claiming an award or ranking, cite the specific source and year
- Use subjective puffery carefully and sparingly (e.g., "We love helping patients see their best" is safer than "#1 eye care in Georgia")

#### DON'T
- Claim to be the **"best," "#1," "top-rated,"** or **"leading"** practice unless you have objective, verifiable evidence to substantiate these claims
- Make **unsubstantiated claims of superiority** over other practitioners (prohibited by Georgia Rule 430-6-.01 and AOA Standards)
- Claim to possess a **"peculiar or particular technique"** or **"degree of training which makes them superior to, or more effective"** than others without substantiation
- Use **"flamboyant or extravagant claims"** about skills that are likely to deceive the public (Georgia Rule 430-4-.01)

### 4.3 "Specialist" Designation and Credentials

#### DO
- Use **"Dr."** title followed by appropriate credential designation (e.g., "Dr. Jane Smith, OD" or "Dr. Jane Smith, Doctor of Optometry")
- State areas of **clinical focus or interest** (e.g., "Our practice focuses on dry eye management and myopia control")
- Reference specific **board certifications** from recognized bodies, naming the certifying organization
- Display license type clearly on the website per Georgia Code 43-1-33

#### DON'T
- Use the term **"specialist"** without including the name of the credentialing entity that conferred the specialty designation
- Reference **"medical specialty titles"** unless the practitioner is a licensed physician (MD/DO) per Georgia Code 43-1-33
- Imply physician-level credentials -- optometrists are "doctors of optometry," not medical doctors
- Use misleading credential abbreviations that could confuse the public about the practitioner's license type

### 4.4 Patient Testimonials and Reviews

#### DO
- Obtain **written HIPAA authorization** before using any patient testimonial, including specifying where and how it will be used
- If testimonial results are not typical, **clearly and conspicuously disclose** the results consumers can generally expect
- Disclose **material connections** -- if the patient received any benefit (discount, free treatment, gift) in exchange for the testimonial
- Allow patients to revoke authorization at any time and honor such requests promptly
- Store testimonial authorization forms securely with patient records

#### DON'T
- Use **fake, fabricated, or AI-generated testimonials** (FTC Consumer Review Rule -- up to $53,088 per violation)
- **Pay for or incentivize** positive reviews or testimonials conditioned on expressing a particular sentiment
- **Suppress negative reviews** through legal threats, intimidation, or false accusations
- Confirm someone's **patient status** when responding to online reviews (HIPAA violation)
- Assume a general photo/video release covers all uses -- a release for website use does **not** automatically permit social media posting
- Use testimonials with **"results not typical"** disclaimer as the only qualification -- FTC research shows these disclaimers are ineffective and insufficient

### 4.5 Before-and-After Photos

#### DO
- Obtain specific **written HIPAA authorization** that names the exact channels (website, specific social media platforms, print) where photos will appear
- Keep photos **unretouched** -- do not photoshop, enhance, or alter images used for marketing
- Ensure photos accurately represent the actual results achieved
- Store photos securely in encrypted, access-controlled systems
- Train all staff handling patient images on privacy requirements

#### DON'T
- Use before-and-after photos without **explicit written authorization** specifying each use case
- **Retouch, photoshop, or enhance** images -- this violates ethical norms and advertising standards
- Present atypical results as representative without disclosing typical outcomes
- Reuse photos across platforms not specified in the original authorization

### 4.6 Pricing and Promotions

#### DO
- Clearly disclose **all conditions and limitations** of promotional pricing
- Specify what services are included in quoted prices (exam, prescription, follow-up care)
- Honor advertised prices and promotions as stated
- Clearly disclose if "free" services are contingent on purchasing other products or services

#### DON'T
- Engage in **bait-and-switch** tactics -- advertising a price or service that is not actually available as advertised (Georgia Rule 430-4-.01)
- **Misuse the word "free"** -- do not advertise "free exam" if the exam is contingent on purchasing eyewear or other products (AOA)
- Advertise prices without specifying what is and is not included
- Use **deceptive demonstrations or prices** (AOA prohibited practice)

### 4.7 Specific Technology Marketing

#### IPL (Intense Pulsed Light)
- **DO**: Reference FDA approval of OptiLight for managing dry eye due to MGD; describe it as "managing" or "treating" dry eye symptoms
- **DON'T**: Claim IPL "cures" dry eye; make claims beyond the FDA-cleared indication (MGD-related dry eye); claim it works for all types of dry eye without qualification

#### MiSight Contact Lenses
- **DO**: Accurately state FDA-approved indication (slowing myopia progression in children 8-12); cite clinical evidence (up to 59% reduction in progression)
- **DON'T**: Claim MiSight "cures" or "reverses" myopia; extend claims beyond the approved age range; guarantee specific outcomes

#### Orthokeratology (Ortho-K)
- **DO**: Describe FDA-cleared use for temporary myopia correction; note that research supports potential for slowing myopia progression but distinguish this from the FDA-cleared indication
- **DON'T**: Market ortho-K as FDA-approved for "myopia control" specifically (this is off-label); claim it permanently corrects vision; guarantee results

#### Scleral Lenses
- **DO**: Describe appropriate clinical uses (keratoconus, irregular cornea, severe dry eye); reference the fitting process and professional oversight required
- **DON'T**: Make therapeutic claims beyond FDA-cleared indications; suggest scleral lenses are a universal solution for all vision problems

#### Low-Level Light Therapy / Other Emerging Treatments
- **DO**: Use cautious language ("emerging treatment," "studies suggest," "may help")
- **DON'T**: Make definitive efficacy claims without strong substantiation; market as proven when evidence is still developing

### 4.8 Website-Specific Requirements (Georgia)

#### DO
- Include the **practitioner's name** and **license type** (OD / Doctor of Optometry) in advertising per Georgia Code 43-1-33
- Ensure the website clearly identifies the **types of health care practitioners** at the practice
- Keep all claims consistent across all pages and platforms (website, Google Business Profile, social media)

#### DON'T
- Omit practitioner credentials or license type from advertising
- Use titles or designations that could mislead the public about the practitioner's qualifications
- Present content that contradicts information on other platforms (inconsistency can be deemed misleading)

## 4.9 Specialty Designations: "Specialist," "Expert," and Practice Naming

This section addresses the specific question of whether optometrists can market themselves as "dry eye specialists," "myopia control specialists," or similar specialty designations.

### The Critical Legal Distinction: Title vs. Description

The most important distinction across US jurisdictions is:

- **"Specialist"** (as a title/designation) -- Generally requires naming the certifying entity that conferred the specialty
- **"Specializing in"** (as a description of practice focus) -- Generally permissible as it describes what you do, not a conferred title
- **"Focused on" / "Dedicated to"** -- Safest language; purely descriptive

Per legal guidance (Bertolino LLP): *"Optometrists may advertise themselves as specializing in a certain type of treatment. However, they may not use the term 'specialist' unless they also include the name of the entity conferring the specialty designation."*

**Source**: [Bertolino LLP -- Advertising Rules for Optometrists](https://www.belolaw.com/blog/advertising-rules-for-optometrists/)

### Georgia-Specific Rules on Specialty Titles

**Georgia Code 43-1-33 (Health Care Practitioners Truth and Transparency Act, SB 197, effective July 2023)**:

- Defines "medical or medical specialty title" as titles originating from physician (MD/DO) specialty training through nationally accredited medical education
- **Prohibits** non-physician health care practitioners from including or referencing "medical or medical specialty titles" in advertisements unless they are a physician licensed under Article 2 of Chapter 34
- Requires all advertisements to "include the practitioner's name and disclose only the type of license under which the health care practitioner is authorized to provide services"

**Key nuance**: "Dry eye specialist" is NOT a recognized ABMS board specialty for physicians either (there is no ABMS board certification in "dry eye"), which weakens the argument that it constitutes a "medical specialty title" under the statute. However, this creates ambiguity -- not safety. The conservative approach is to avoid the standalone title.

**Georgia Board Rules 430-4-.01 and 430-6-.01** prohibit "flamboyant or extravagant claims" about skills and "unsubstantiated claims of superiority," but notably **neither rule specifically addresses the word "specialist."** The risk comes from the broader deception standard.

### Safe vs. Risky Language for Specialty Marketing

#### SAFE (use these)

| Phrasing | Why It Works |
|----------|-------------|
| "Our practice **focuses on** dry eye management" | Describes services, not a title |
| "Dr. [Name], OD, FAAO -- **specializing in** ocular surface disease" | Credential listed + practice description |
| "**With advanced training in** dry eye treatment" | Factual if OD has relevant CE/residency |
| "**Dedicated to** dry eye diagnosis and treatment" | Aspirational, not a credential claim |
| "[Practice] **Dry Eye Center**" or "**Dry Eye Clinic**" | Facility/service descriptor, not a credential |
| "**TearLab Accredited Dry Eye Center**" | Named third-party accreditation |
| "Dr. [Name], OD, **FIAOMC** -- specializing in myopia management" | Credential + description |
| "**Comprehensive dry eye diagnostics** and treatment" | Service description |

#### RISKY (avoid these)

| Phrasing | Why It's Risky |
|----------|---------------|
| "Dr. [Name], **Dry Eye Specialist**" | Uses "specialist" as title without certifying entity |
| "**Board Certified Dry Eye Specialist**" | No such board certification exists |
| "**Myopia Control Specialist**" | Without naming AAOMC/FIAOMC |
| "**Pediatric Eye Care Specialist**" | Could imply pediatric ophthalmology (a medical specialty) |
| "**The leading dry eye expert in Georgia**" | Unsubstantiable superiority claim |
| "**Certified Dry Eye Expert**" | What certification? Must name the body |

#### MODERATE RISK (context-dependent)

| Phrasing | Analysis |
|----------|----------|
| "Dry Eye Specialist" as a web page title | Less risky for SEO but still ambiguous as a claim |
| "Dr. [Name] is our dry eye specialist" | Descriptor vs. credential -- gray area |
| "Center of Excellence" (self-designated) | Without third-party accreditation, could be challenged |

### Practice Naming and Division Branding

| Term | Risk Level | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **"Dry Eye Clinic"** or **"Dry Eye Center"** | LOW | Service descriptor; widely used safely |
| **"Dry Eye Spa"** | LOW | Branded service name (CVC already uses this appropriately) |
| **"TearLab Accredited Dry Eye Center of Excellence"** | LOW | Named, verifiable third-party accreditation |
| **"Dry Eye Center of Excellence"** (self-designated) | MODERATE | Without third-party backing, could be challenged as unsubstantiated superiority |
| **"Advanced Dry Eye Treatment Center"** | LOW | Describes capability |
| **"Myopia Management Center"** | LOW | Service descriptor |

### How Residency Completion Changes What You Can Claim

Completing a relevant residency (cornea/contact lens, pediatric, etc.) does NOT confer a "specialist" title by itself. However, it does:

- Provide factual basis for stating "with advanced clinical training in [area]"
- Qualify the OD for fellowship/diplomate programs that DO confer recognized credentials
- Make it more defensible to use "specializing in" or "focused practice in" language

### Recommended Approach for Classic Vision Care

**For Individual Doctor Marketing:**
1. List actual credentials after name: "Dr. [Name], OD" (add FAAO, Diplomate, FIAOMC, FCOVD if held)
2. Use "focused on" or "with a focus on" language (safest)
3. If using "specializing in," ensure it describes practice focus, not a conferred title
4. Reference specific training: "with advanced training in [area]" only if factually true
5. **Never** use "specialist" as a standalone title without naming the certifying body

**For Practice/Service Marketing:**
1. "Classic Vision Care Dry Eye Spa" -- already in use, appropriate
2. Consider: "Classic Vision Care Dry Eye Center" if expanding branding
3. Pursue TearLab or manufacturer accreditations and reference them by name
4. Describe services offered rather than making credential claims
5. For myopia: reference AAOMC certifications if doctors hold them

**For SEO and Digital Marketing:**
1. Primary keywords: "dry eye treatment [city]," "dry eye doctor [city]"
2. "Dry eye specialist" is a high-volume patient search term -- can appear in educational content describing what patients look for, but avoid using it as a personal title or in structured data
3. Page titles like "Dry Eye Treatment Center in Kennesaw" are safer than "Dry Eye Specialist in Kennesaw"

## 5. Common Risky Phrases -- Quick Reference

| Risky Phrase | Risk Level | Safer Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "Cure your dry eye" | HIGH | "Manage your dry eye symptoms" or "Find relief from dry eye" |
| "We guarantee results" | HIGH | "Our treatments are backed by clinical research" |
| "#1 eye doctor in [city]" | HIGH | "Trusted by [X] families in [city]" (if verifiable) |
| "Best eye care in Georgia" | HIGH | "Dedicated to providing excellent eye care" |
| "Specialist in dry eye" | MEDIUM | "Focused on dry eye management" or include certifying body |
| "Eliminate myopia" | HIGH | "Slow myopia progression" (with evidence citation) |
| "Painless treatment" | MEDIUM | "Comfortable treatment experience" (with appropriate qualification) |
| "Results not typical" | MEDIUM | Must disclose what results consumers CAN typically expect |
| "Free eye exam" (with conditions) | MEDIUM | "Complimentary eye exam with purchase of [X]" (full disclosure) |
| "Revolutionary/breakthrough treatment" | MEDIUM | "Advanced treatment option" or "FDA-approved treatment" |
| "Safe and effective" | MEDIUM | "FDA-approved" (if true) or cite specific safety/efficacy data |
| "World-class care" | LOW-MEDIUM | Acceptable as puffery but stronger with substantiation |
| "State-of-the-art technology" | LOW | Generally acceptable as puffery; describe the specific technology |
